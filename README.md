# Better Bike Angel Map (BBAM)
Originally this was intended to be a better bike angel (the branding name for Citibike's incentive program for riders to move bikes from some stations to some other station).

In early 2021, Lyft (the owner of the company operating Citibike) revamped the app and they made the new app harder to get info out of quicker (namely, info now pops up on the map as you pan around rather than having everything already being loaded immediately). So I've updated this app to give more info at a glance. Meaning, I now include the number of bikes available and number of docks available at each bike station.

## Code Quality
This app is not intended to be a shining example of code quality. In fact, this app was built as quickly as possible. 

## Development Instructions
1. Clone this repo and `cd` in.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
